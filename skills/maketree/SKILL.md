# Maketree - Global Worktree Manager

Automatically detect feature branches and create git worktrees for parallel development in any project.

## Commands

- `/maketree` - Detect local config or run discovery, then create worktrees
- `/maketree list` - List all active worktrees
- `/maketree clean` - Remove all feature worktrees (keeps main repo)
- `/maketree discover` - Force re-discovery even if config exists

## What It Does

This skill automatically:
1. Checks for local `.worktree-scaffold.json` configuration
2. If no config exists, discovers feature branches and recommends worktrees
3. Presents a numbered table for user selection
4. Saves preferences to `.worktree-scaffold.json`
5. Creates worktrees for selected branches

## Discovery Flow

When run in a project without configuration:

```
Discovered Feature Branches:
| #  | Name              | Branch                  | Path                    |
|----|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1  | user-auth         | feature/user-auth       | ../user-auth            |
| 2  | payment-flow      | feature/payment-flow    | ../payment-flow         |
| 3  | dark-mode         | fix/dark-mode           | ../dark-mode            |

Enter selection: all, numbers (1,2,3), or skip
```

## Configuration

The skill uses `.worktree-scaffold.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "worktreeDir": "../",
  "branchPrefix": "feature/",
  "worktrees": [
    { "name": "user-auth", "branch": "feature/user-auth" },
    { "name": "payment-flow", "branch": "feature/payment-flow" }
  ]
}
```

### Config Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `worktreeDir` | string | `"../"` | Directory for worktrees relative to repo |
| `branchPrefix` | string | `"feature/"` | Default prefix for new branches |
| `worktrees` | array | `[]` | Saved worktree selections from discovery |

## Directory Structure

After running `/maketree`:

```
/path/to/projects/
├── my-project/           # Main repository (main branch)
├── user-auth/            # feature/user-auth worktree
├── payment-flow/         # feature/payment-flow worktree
└── dark-mode/            # fix/dark-mode worktree
```

## Requirements

- Git 2.20+ with worktree support
- Must be run from within a git repository
- Write access to parent directory for worktree creation

## Benefits

- **Parallel Development**: Work on multiple features simultaneously
- **Branch Isolation**: Each feature has its own clean workspace
- **Fast Switching**: No need to stash/commit when switching features
- **Project Agnostic**: Works with any git repository
- **Persistent Config**: Saves preferences for quick re-creation

## Example Output

```
Existing config found. Creating worktrees...

Created Worktrees:
✓ user-auth               /path/to/projects/user-auth
✓ payment-flow            /path/to/projects/payment-flow

Already Existed:
• dark-mode               /path/to/projects/dark-mode

Terminal Commands:
cd /path/to/projects/user-auth
cd /path/to/projects/payment-flow
cd /path/to/projects/dark-mode
```

## Notes

- Each worktree is a full working directory with its own checkout
- `.git` directory is shared (repository data shared, working trees are not)
- Changes, commits, and branches are visible across all worktrees
- Deleting a worktree doesn't delete the branch
- Run `/maketree discover` to re-scan branches and update config
