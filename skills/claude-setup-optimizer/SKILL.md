# Claude Setup Optimizer

Automatically analyzes the Claude Code changelog and recommends improvements to your agents, skills, and configuration based on new features.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Fetches Latest Changelog** - Gets the most recent Claude Code changelog from official sources
2. **Analyzes Your Setup** - Reviews all your agents, skills, commands, and configuration
3. **Identifies Opportunities** - Finds ways your setup could benefit from new Claude features
4. **Recommends Improvements** - Provides specific, actionable recommendations
5. **Implements Changes** - Optionally applies improvements automatically

## Paths

### Portable iCloud Path Variable

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `$HOME` in bash commands and `~/` in documentation to ensure portability across different machines/users.

**Define this variable at the start of any bash operations:**

```bash
ICLOUD_SETUP="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup"
```

**Source of Truth Structure:**

```
~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup/
├── skills/       ← All skills
├── agents/       ← All agents
├── commands/     ← All commands
├── memory/       ← Memory files (core-memory.json, etc.)
└── settings.json ← Settings
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always read from AND write to the iCloud path directly. Do NOT use symlink paths like `~/.claude/` - use the iCloud path to ensure:
- Consistent behavior regardless of symlink state
- Changes persist correctly to iCloud
- Syncs across all devices

### Background (FYI only)

Claude Code searches for skills/agents in multiple locations, but symlinks point everything to iCloud:

- `~/.claude/skills` → iCloud
- `~/.claude/agents` → iCloud
- `~/.claude/commands` → iCloud

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Claude Code Changelog

Fetch the latest Claude Code changelog using strategies that handle large files:

**Primary Source - GitHub CLI (Recommended):**

Use the `gh` CLI to fetch recent releases which avoids large file issues:

```bash
# Get the 5 most recent releases with full details
gh release list --repo anthropics/claude-code --limit 5

# Get detailed notes for a specific release
gh release view <tag> --repo anthropics/claude-code
```

**Secondary Source - GitHub Releases Page:**

Use WebFetch on the releases page (summarized, not full changelog):

```
https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases
```

Prompt: "Extract the 3 most recent releases with their version numbers, dates, and key new features. Focus on: new tools, skill/agent updates, MCP changes, configuration options."

**Tertiary Source - Web Search:**

Search for "Claude Code changelog 2026" or "Claude Code new features" for recent announcements.

**IMPORTANT: Avoid fetching the full CHANGELOG.md file directly** - it exceeds token limits (~32K tokens). If you must read it, use the Read tool with `limit` parameter to read only the first 500 lines:

```
Read file with limit=500 to get only recent entries
```

Extract key information:

- New features and capabilities
- New tools or MCP changes
- Skill/agent system updates
- Configuration options
- Breaking changes
- Best practice updates

### Step 2: Analyze Current Setup (Parallel)

**IMPORTANT:** Always use the iCloud path as the source of truth:
`~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup`

**Use parallel Task agents to inventory everything concurrently.** Launch these in a single message:

1. **Skills inventory agent** - Read all SKILL.md frontmatter from every skill directory under `skills/`. Extract name, description, allowed-tools, context, model, and any other frontmatter fields. Return the complete frontmatter for each skill.

2. **Agents inventory agent** - Read all agent .md files from `agents/` (including subdirectories like `review/`). Extract name, description, allowed-tools, disallowedTools, model, color, skills, and any other frontmatter fields. Return the complete frontmatter for each agent.

3. **Config inventory agent** - Read settings.json from the iCloud path and ~/.claude.json. Also list all commands in `commands/`. Return the full configuration content.

All three agents should use `subagent_type="Explore"` and `run_in_background=true`.

Wait for all agents to complete, then proceed to Step 3 with the combined inventory data.

### Step 3: Compare and Identify Opportunities

Cross-reference changelog features against your current setup:

**Feature Categories to Check:**

1. **New Tools**: Are there new tools you're not using that could benefit your workflows?
2. **Skill System Updates**: Has the skill format changed? Are there new frontmatter options?
3. **Agent Improvements**: New agent capabilities or patterns?
4. **MCP Updates**: New MCP servers or protocol changes?
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Parallelization, caching, or efficiency improvements?
6. **Security Features**: New permission patterns or security best practices?
7. **Configuration Options**: New settings that could improve your experience?

**Analysis Checklist:**

For each skill/agent, check:

- [ ] Uses latest skill format (SKILL.md with frontmatter)
- [ ] Takes advantage of parallel tool calls where applicable
- [ ] Uses appropriate model selection (haiku for fast tasks, etc.)
- [ ] Has proper error handling patterns
- [ ] Follows current best practices for triggers/descriptions
- [ ] Uses new tools/features that weren't available before

### Step 4: Generate Recommendations

Create a structured report with:

**Priority Levels:**

- **HIGH**: Security improvements, breaking change migrations, significant efficiency gains
- **MEDIUM**: New feature adoption, best practice updates
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements, style updates

**Recommendation Format:**

```markdown
## [Priority] Recommendation Title

**Affected Items:** skill-name, agent-name, etc.

**Current State:**
Description of how it works now

**Recommended Change:**
What should be changed and why

**New Feature Reference:**
Link to changelog or documentation

**Implementation:**
Specific steps or code changes needed

**Effort:** Low/Medium/High
```

### Step 5: Present and Confirm

Present findings to the user:

```
# Claude Setup Optimization Report

## Changelog Summary
- Version X.Y.Z released on DATE
- Key new features: [list]

## Your Setup Analysis
- X skills analyzed
- Y agents analyzed
- Z commands analyzed

## Recommendations Found: N

### High Priority (M items)
1. [Brief description]
2. ...

### Medium Priority (N items)
1. ...

### Low Priority (P items)
1. ...

Would you like me to:
1. Show detailed recommendations for all items
2. Show only HIGH priority recommendations
3. Auto-implement all HIGH priority changes
4. Auto-implement specific recommendations
5. Skip implementation (just review)
```

### Step 6: Implement Improvements with Parallel Agents

**IMPORTANT: iCloud is the source of truth.** All changes MUST be made directly in the iCloud path to ensure they sync across devices.

**CRITICAL: Use parallel Task agents to implement changes concurrently.** Group approved changes into independent work streams and launch them as parallel agents. This dramatically speeds up implementation.

#### 6a. Back up affected files first

```bash
ICLOUD_SETUP="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup"
mkdir -p "$ICLOUD_SETUP/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
cp <file> "$ICLOUD_SETUP/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/"
```

#### 6b. Group changes into independent work streams

Categorize approved changes into groups that can run in parallel without conflicts (no two agents should edit the same file):

- **Skills agent**: All SKILL.md frontmatter and body changes
- **Agents agent**: All agent .md file changes
- **Config agent**: settings.json, hooks, and other config changes
- **Filesystem agent**: Directory moves, file deletions, archive operations

If a group touches too many files, split further (e.g., separate M&A skills from dev skills).

#### 6c. Launch parallel agents

Use the Task tool to launch multiple agents in a **single message** with multiple tool calls. Each agent gets a detailed prompt listing exactly which files to change and what to do.

Example pattern:

```
# In a SINGLE message, launch all these Task calls simultaneously:

Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Fix skill frontmatter", prompt="Read and edit these SKILL.md files: [list]. For each: [specific changes]...", run_in_background=true)

Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Update agent files", prompt="Read and edit these agent .md files: [list]. For each: [specific changes]...", run_in_background=true)

Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Update config files", prompt="Read and edit settings.json: [specific changes]...", run_in_background=true)
```

**Rules for parallel agents:**
- Each agent prompt must be self-contained with ALL context needed (file paths, exact changes)
- No agent should edit a file that another agent is also editing
- Use `run_in_background=true` to launch them concurrently
- Wait for all agents to complete, then verify results
- If a change depends on another change, put them in the same agent or run sequentially

#### 6d. Verify all changes

After all agents complete, spot-check key files to confirm changes were applied correctly. Read the frontmatter of a few modified files to verify.

#### 6e. Auto-commit and push to GitHub

After all approved changes are verified, automatically commit and push to the backup repo:

```bash
ICLOUD_SETUP="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup"
cd "$ICLOUD_SETUP"

# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: apply claude-setup-optimizer recommendations

Changes applied:
- [list of changes made]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push to GitHub backup repo
git push origin master
```

**GitHub Backup Repo:** https://github.com/escotilha/claude

This step runs automatically after implementing approved changes - no user confirmation needed.

**New Feature Reference:**
Task tool now supports parallel agent launches

**Implementation:**
Update the workflow section to specify parallel launch pattern for independent tasks.

**Effort:** Medium
````

### Example 3: Skill Format Migration

```markdown
## [HIGH] Migrate legacy .skill files to SKILL.md format

**Affected Items:** financial-data-extractor.skill

**Current State:**
Using legacy .skill format

**Recommended Change:**
Migrate to new SKILL.md format with YAML frontmatter for better Claude recognition and metadata support.

**New Feature Reference:**
SKILL.md is now the recommended format

**Implementation:**

1. Rename file to SKILL.md
2. Add YAML frontmatter with name, description, allowed-tools
3. Update content to match new format

**Effort:** Low
```

## Triggers

This skill activates on:

- "optimize my claude setup"
- "check claude code updates"
- "improve my agents"
- "sync with claude changelog"
- "what's new in claude code"
- "update my skills for new features"
- "/optimize-setup"

## Error Handling

### Large File Errors

If you encounter "File content exceeds maximum allowed tokens" when fetching changelog:

1. **Use `gh` CLI instead** - Fetch releases via `gh release list` and `gh release view`
2. **Read with limits** - Use `Read` tool with `limit=500` to get only recent entries
3. **Use WebSearch** - Search for "Claude Code new features 2026" for recent announcements
4. **Fetch releases page** - WebFetch the releases page with a focused prompt

Never attempt to fetch the full CHANGELOG.md via WebFetch - it's too large.

## Notes

- Always preserve existing functionality when making changes
- Create backups before modifying files
- Test changes before committing
- Some recommendations may require manual review
- Keep track of which changelog versions have been reviewed to avoid duplicate work
- All paths use `$HOME` variable for cross-machine compatibility
